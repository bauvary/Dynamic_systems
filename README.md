# Dynamic systems
Dynamics systems stadies <br>
These studies are done to understand dynamic systems in part.<br>

On the other hand a study is made on the satiety hormone called leptin and on the resistance to leptin:<br>

        Leptin <br>
        Leptin study model <br>
        Mathematical model of leptin resistance <br>
        Study of the stability of the system <br>

        Stability of equilibria <br>
        Variable food consumption <br>
        Simulations <br>
        Conclusion <br>
 
And the other documents deal with the digital schemes of dynamic systems.
